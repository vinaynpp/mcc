## MCC experiments 
| Sr no. |  Title  |
|--------------|-------|
| 1 | To understand the cellular frequency reuse concept to find the co-channel cells for a particular cell. Design a game based application on the above concept.|
| 2 | To understand the cellular frequency reuse concept to find the cell clusters within certaingeographic area. Design a game based application on the above concept.|
| 3 | Implementation a Bluetooth network with application as transfer of a file from one device to another. |
| 4 | To implement a basic function of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) to test the orthogonality and autocorrelation of a code to be used for CDMA operation. Write an application based on the above concept. |
| 5 | To implement Mobile node discovery |
| 6 | Implementation of GSM security algorithms (A3/A5/A8) |
| 7 | Illustration of Hidden Terminal Problem (NS-2) Consider two Wifi base stations (STA) and an access point (AP) located along the x-axis. All the nodes are fixed. The AP is situated at the middle of the two STA, the distance of separation being 150 m. [variable]. Node #0 and node #1 are the hidden terminals. Both are transmitting some data to the AP (almost at same rate) at the same time. The loss across the wireless link between each STA and the AP is fixed at 50 dB irrespective of the distance of separation. To study how RTS/CTS helps in wireless networks, 1.	No RTS/CTS is being sent. 2.	Nodes do exchange RTS/CTS packets. Compare the no. of packet retransmissions required in both the cases (as obtained in the output) and compare the results. |
| 8 | To setup & configuration of Wireless Access Point (AP) using NS3. Analyze the Wi-Fi communication range in the presence of the access point (AP) and the base station (BS). Consider BS and AP are static. Find out the maximum distance to which two way communications is possible. Try multiple iterations by adjusting its distance in the code and test it. |
| 9 | Develop an application that writes data to the SD card. |
| 10 | Develop an application that uses GUI components. |
| 11 | Write an application that draws basic graphical primitives on the screen. |
| 12 | Develop an application that makes use of database. |
| 13 | Develop a native application that uses GPS location information. |
| 14 | Implement an application that creates an alert upon receiving a message. |
| 15 | Implementation of income tax/loan EMI calculator and deploy the same on real devices. |
